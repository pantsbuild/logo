## Provenance

### Original artist

The original artist of the Pants build system logo is David DeSandro (@desandro).
See their portfolio site [desandro.com](https://desandro.com), [Dribbble post](https://dribbble.com/shots/1388666-Pants-logo), 
and [Tweet](https://twitter.com/desandro/status/426011317296578561) from 2014. 

With regard to assignment of this logo, the original artist has stated:

"I designed this logo specifically for the Pants team at Twitter while I was employed at Twitter. 
As I designed this logo on Twitter hardward during normal working hours at Twitter, it may be 
considered 'work for hire,' and the property of Twitter, Inc. at the time. 

As the Pants project was later released from Twitter's governance to a separate organization, 
the logo went with it. The Pants Build organization may use the logo however they like."
